# Project-2019
# Program and Scripting Project 2019 Fisher's Iris Data

## Introduction

The Iris flower data is a multivariate dataset introduced by biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936 in his paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems."* It is an excellent example of linear discrimniant. This is based on the concept of searching for a  linear combination of variables that best seperates two classes. 

## About the Iris Dataset

The dataset consists of fifty samples from three species of iris (*Iris setosa, Iris virginica* and *Iris versicolor*).

- The iris dataset contains the following data
  - 50 samples of the 3 different species of iris (150 samples in total)
  - Measurements: sepal lenght, sepal width, patal length and petal width.
- The format for the data: (sepal lenght, sepal width, petal lenght, petal width)#2
