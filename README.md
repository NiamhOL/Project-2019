# Project-2019
# Program and Scripting Project 2019 Fisher's Iris Data

## Introduction

The Iris flower data is a multivariate dataset introduced by biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936 in his paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems."* It is an excellent example of linear discrimniant. This is based on the concept of searching for a  linear combination of variables that best seperates two classes. The dataset consists of fifty samples from three species of iris (*Iris setosa, Iris virginica* and *Iris versicolor*). Four features were measured from each sampled flower: the lenght of the sepals, the width of the sepals, the lenght of the petals and the width of the petals. The dataset consists of five columns with one hundred and fifty measurements from the sample flowers.
